        <p>A trip to Norfolk is always an adventure. A glance at the map and it almost feels like it could be round the
            corner. In relative terms, it is. The mileage isn't significant, but the time required is. The equivalent
            journey time and a flight to southern Spain would have been perfectly achievable. The long and winding road
            came to a grinding halt in Grantham, just across the Lincolnshire border. The crowds had come to see the
            statue of the "Grocer's Daughter". Only joking, it was some roadworks with 3 way traffic lights on a pivotal
            junction. The temperatures were rising and certainly in the opposite direction, so was the frustration of
            the queuing motorists. The line snaked up the hill towards the army barracks. I made a mental note to avoid
            the bottleneck on the return journey.</p>
