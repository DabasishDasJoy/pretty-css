            <p>I’m an <span class="investigation">investigative</span> with over two decades of experience. I’ve covered
                both Milan’s fashion
                week
                and the U.S. primaries in the same year. Above all, I believe that fair and free press is fundamental to
                a
                healthy society – the core ideal behind my work. I offer professional, unbiased, and timely articles,
                along
                with cited sources, and the highest regard for journalistic integrity you can find.</p>
